        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Butter and flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assemble the casserole:</strong> Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the casserole:</strong> Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
        </ol>
